|		    | - Make sure that there is a network in the SUT (system under |
|                   |	test)                                                      |

| Test Summary      | - Tests exercised ethernet cards properly by means of iperf  |
| Criteria          | - The bitrate that appeared in the results is close to the   |
|		    |	throughput that each port can support.                     |
|		    | - It is possible to assign and exercise virtual functions to |
|		    |	the VM through SRIOV and link to network cards where they  |
|		    |	ensure stability for the VM.                               |
